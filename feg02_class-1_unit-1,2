- Example:
  - **Topic sentence**: *"The vast majority of people... come in contact with animals."*
  - **Supporting examples**: Hunter, Farmer, Fisherman, City dweller.

## 1.4 Coherence
- **Coherence**: Ensures that one sentence logically leads to the next. A coherent paragraph has clear flow between ideas.
- **Transitional Devices**: Words/phrases like "first", "next", "therefore" help in maintaining coherence.

---

## 1.5 Punctuation: The Full Stop
- Full stops mark the end of a sentence, abbreviated words, or in cases like "Dr" and "TV".
