### MCS201(Programming in C and Python)

#what is programming ?
Set of instruction to solve a particular problem.
    what is an instruction ?
    1. any type of instruction that provide to computer to solve that probelem.
    2. those input what we provides to computer.
    
##Why programming is required ?
We required the programming to solve specific problem.
                                              ##What is the problem ?
                                              1. A task we need to solve  
                                              2. Probelm is situation 
                                                 TECHNIQUE TO SOLVE A PROBLEM
                                                 1. understand the problem - what the probelem is ?
                                                 2. what should be the output/result ?
                                                    (In programming first we need solution to take that as problem and solve in the form of programming.)
                                                  3. what are the basic requirment for the specific result ?
                                                  4. Arrangment of the requirement in sequesnce in order to solve problme.
                                                    for example - Add two numbers. 
                                                           Basic requirement - need two numbers
                                                           Arrangment - is number are (a, b) then arrangement is - c = (a + b)
                                                           Result after calculationg arrangement.
                                                           This is what - how we do programming.
About chapter from book, chapter says
## Problem solving technique
1. problem definotion phase(understanding the problem)
2. getting started with problem(immediatly take action toward problem)
3. The use of specific example (we can take example of previusly done problem)
4. similiarities in the problem (what are the similarities are there ?)
these are the steps for solving a probelm.
In problem solving problem we have ALGORITHM and FLOWCHART
 
#BASIC OF ALGORITHM  - FLOWCHART (exam 10 - 15 marks)
###What is the ALGORITHM ?
The step by step procedure to solve any kind of problem
Algorithm is the proceed to solve any kind of problem
 
##What is Flowchart ?
A pictorial or graphical represantaion of algorithm.

##Write an algorithm of addition of two number ?
STEP 1 - start.
STEP 2 - Enter two numbers (a ,b).
STEP 3 - Add both numbers and store result.(i.e - result = a + b).
STEP 4 - print the result.
STEP 5 - Stop.
This is first algorithm

###SYMBOLS OF FLOWCHART :-
SHAPE            WORK      
Ovel             start/stop
Parallelogram      input/output
Rectangle        process
Diamond          decision making
Arows            flow of direction.

##Write a Flowchart of sum of the numbes ?
  [Start](ovel)
     |
     v
  [Input A]________
     |             |
     v             |-(parallelogram)
  [Input B]________|
     |
     v
  [SUM = A + B](rectangle)
     |
     v
  [Display SUM](paralleelogram)
     |
     v
  [End](ovel)

NOTE - if flowchhart not come in one page so we want to go another page then what we do ? - use anotation ! 

##Write a algorithm to print 1 to 10
STEP 1 - Start
STEP 2 - initialize st = 1 and end = 10
STEP 3 - print st
STEP 4 - increament st by 1
STEP 5 - check if st <= end ,repeat step 3 and 4       
STEP 6 - Stop.

##Draw a flowchart to print 1 to 10.
[start](ovel)
   |
   v
[st = 1, end = 10](rectangle)
   |
   v
[print st](parallelogram)<-----------
   |                                |
   v                                |
[st += 1](rectangle)                |
    |                               |
    v                               |
 [st <= end](diamond)----------------
    |
    v
  [stop](oval)

##Feature of alogrithm :-
1. input
2. output 
3. definiteness 
4. finiteness 
5. effectiveness
6. correcteness

##Write an algorithm to calculate the factorial of a given number.(HOMEWORK)
                                    what is factorial ?
                                   it is denoted by n! means n! = n(n -1)(n - 2)(n - 3)........ 
i.g - how factorial works - 
number       f = f * number(f = 1)        NewNumber(number - 1)      NewNumber > 0
5              1 * 5 = 5                   5 - 1 = 4                  is 4 > 0 :- No
4              5 * 4 = 20                  4 - 1 = 3                  is 3 > 0 :- No
3              20 * 3 = 60                 3 - 1 = 2                  is 2 > 0 :- No
2              60 * 2 = 120                2 - 1 = 1                  is 1 > 0 :- No
1              120 * 1 = 120               1 - 1 = 0                  is 0 > 0 :- No loops terminated 




##write an algorithm to check that whether the given number is prime or not.(HOMEWORK)
logic ;-
let suppose we have a number 5 
n = 5
calculation (function) = n / (n-1 from 5 to 2).
  if we took n and devide 2 to 5
  if we took n annd devide 2 to n/2

**There is multiple way to solve a problem 
but initially there is two approaches to solve the problem
1. Top - Down
2. Bottom - Down

#TOP - DOWN DESIGN
     COMPLEX PROBLEM
    /       |       \
 [s -1]  [s - 2]  [s - 3]
/      \  /    \  /      \ .....
The set of solution of subproblem is called complex solution.

#BOTTOM - DOWN
It comes under dyanamics problem and greedy technique.(out of syllabus)

**Question - reasoning**
What is programming language ?
Those language through which we write programme is called as programming langauge.
nowdays varios kind of programming languages exits
Basically programming language can be divided intoo two parts that is low  - level language and high  - level language.

High - level lenaguge ;- Those language whos needs translator to translate the program to make computer understandable.
Low - level language :-Those language which is direclty excutable by machine.  

Two things also works between the user - computer communication
1. Linker :- it is a specific program which is used to link particular data to the specific library.
2. Loader :- it is also a specific program which is use to specified dyanamical memory allocation to each and every instruction(programe).

##HISTORY OF C PROGRAMMING :-
1. it is developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 USA at AT&T lab.
2. it is known by B but after a lots implementation on B it named C.
3. it is neither low or high level language therefore it is mid - level languge because it is work between operating system and spreadsheet, transaction.

##What is an ERROR :-
1. which is not being accpetable is error.
2. those which is violenting the rule is error.
3. those which in not follwo grammer is called error.

~~HOME WORK~~
read linker error and loader error.
