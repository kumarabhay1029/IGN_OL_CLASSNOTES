MCS201(Programming in C and Python)
what is programming ?
Set of instruction to solve a particular problem.
    what is an instruction ?
    1. any type of instruction that provide to computer to solve that probelem.
    2. those input what we provides to computer.
    
Why programming is requred ?
We required the programming to solve specific problem.
                                              what is the problem ?
                                              1. A task we need to solve  
                                              2. Probelm is situation 
                                                 TECHNIQUE TO SOLVE A PROBLEM
                                                 1. understand the problem - what the probelem is ?
                                                 2. what should be the output/result ?
                                                  in programming first we need solution to take that as problem and solve in the form of programming.
                                                  
                                                  3. what are the basic requirment for the specific result ?
                                                  4. Arrangment of the requirement in sequesnce in order to solve problme.
                                                    for example - Add two numbers. 
                                                           Basic requirement - need two numbers
                                                           Arrangment - is number are (a, b) then arrangement is - c = (a + b)
                                                           Result after calculationg arrangement.
                                                           This is what - how we do programming.
about chapter from book chapter says
Problem solving technique
1. problem definotion phase(understanding the problem)
2. getting started with problem(immediatly take action toward problem)
3. The use of specific example (we can take example of previusly done problem)
4. similiarities in the problem (what are the similarities are there ?)
these are the steps for solving a probelm.
 In problem solving problem we have ALGORITHM and FLOWCHART
 
ALGORITHM  - FLOWCHART (exam 10 - 15 marks)
What is the ALGORITHM ?
The step by step procedure to solve any kind of problem
Algorithm is the proceed to solve any kind of problem
 
What is Flowchart ?
A pictorial or graphical represantaion of algorithm.

Write an algorithm of addition of two number ?
STEP 1 - start.
STEP 2 - Enter two numbers (a ,b).
STEP 3 - Add both numbers and store result.(i.e - result = a + b).
STEP 4 - print the result.
STEP 5 - Stop.
This is first algorithm

SYMBOLS OF FLOWCHART :-
SHAPE            WORK      
Ovel             start/stop
Parallelogram      input/output
Rectangle        process
Diamond          decision making
Arows            flow of direction.

Write a Flowchart of sum of the numbes ?
  [Start](ovel)
     |
     v
  [Input A]________
     |             |
     v             |-(parallelogram)
  [Input B]________|
     |
     v
  [SUM = A + B](rectangle)
     |
     v
  [Display SUM](paralleelogram)
     |
     v
  [End](ovel)
