### MCS201 (Programming in C and Python)

---

## What is Programming?
- A set of instructions to solve a particular problem.

### What is an instruction?
1. Any type of instruction provided to a computer to solve that problem.
2. Inputs that we provide to the computer.

---

## Why Programming is Required?
- We need programming to solve specific problems.

### What is a problem?
1. A task we need to solve.
2. A situation that needs a solution.

---

## Technique to Solve a Problem
1. Understand the problem – What is the problem?
2. What should be the output/result?
   - *(In programming, we must first understand the solution, then solve it using programming.)*
3. What are the basic requirements for the result?
4. Arrange the requirements in sequence to solve the problem.

**Example – Add two numbers**  
- Basic requirement: Two numbers.  
- Arrangement: If numbers are (a, b), then: `c = a + b`.  
- Result is obtained after calculating this.

---

## As per Book – Problem Solving Techniques
1. Problem definition phase (understand the problem)
2. Getting started with the problem (take immediate action)
3. Use of specific examples (from past experience)
4. Find similarities with other problems

These are the steps for solving a problem. In programming, we use:

- **Algorithm**
- **Flowchart**

## Basics of Algorithm & Flowchart (Important for Exam: 10–15 marks)

### What is an Algorithm?
- A step-by-step procedure to solve any kind of problem.

### What is a Flowchart?
- A pictorial/graphical representation of an algorithm.

## Algorithm: Addition of Two Numbers

1. Start  
2. Enter two numbers (a, b)  
3. Add both numbers → `result = a + b`  
4. Print the result  
5. Stop

## Flowchart Symbols:

| Shape         | Purpose               |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| Oval          | Start/Stop            |
| Parallelogram | Input/Output          |
| Rectangle     | Process               |
| Diamond       | Decision Making       |
| Arrow         | Flow of Direction     |

---

## Flowchart: Sum of Two Numbers

```
[Start] (oval)
   |
   v
[Input A] (parallelogram)
   |
   v
[Input B] (parallelogram)
   |
   v
[SUM = A + B] (rectangle)
   |
   v
[Display SUM] (parallelogram)
   |
   v
[End] (oval)
```

*Note: If the flowchart goes to the next page, use annotation symbols.*

## Algorithm: Print 1 to 10

1. Start  
2. Initialize `st = 1`, `end = 10`  
3. Print `st`  
4. Increment `st` by 1  
5. If `st <= end`, repeat steps 3–4  
6. Stop

---

## Flowchart: Print 1 to 10

```
[Start]
   |
   v
[st = 1, end = 10]
   |
   v
[Print st] <-------
   |              |
   v              |
[st = st + 1]     |
   |              |
   v              |
[st <= end] ------|
   |
   v
[Stop]
```

## Features of Algorithm
1. Input  
2. Output  
3. Definiteness  
4. Finiteness  
5. Effectiveness  
6. Correctness

## Homework:

### 1. Algorithm: Factorial of a Number  
**What is factorial?**  
- Denoted as `n!`  
- Formula: `n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1`  

Example:  
```
n = 5  
f = 1  
f = f * 5 = 5  
f = 5 * 4 = 20  
f = 20 * 3 = 60  
f = 60 * 2 = 120  
f = 120 * 1 = 120  
```

### 2. Algorithm: Check if Number is Prime  
**Logic:**  
- Let `n = 5`  
- Check divisibility from 2 to `n/2`  
- If divisible, it’s not prime. Else, it is.

## Problem-Solving Approaches:

### 1. Top-Down Design  
- Break the complex problem into sub-problems:  
```
  COMPLEX PROBLEM
   /     |     \
 [S1]  [S2]   [S3]
 / \    / \    / \
```
- Combine solutions of sub-problems for the final answer.

### 2. Bottom-Up Design *(Dynamic Programming/Greedy – Out of Syllabus)*

## Question: What is a Programming Language?
- Languages used to write programs.

**Types:**
- **High-Level Language:** Requires translator (compiler/interpreter)
- **Low-Level Language:** Directly executed by machine

---

## Between User and Computer Communication:

1. **Linker** – Links code to the required libraries  
2. **Loader** – Allocates memory dynamically for program execution

---

## History of C Programming

1. Developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in **1972** at **AT&T Labs (USA)**  
2. Evolved from language **B**  
3. Considered a **mid-level language**  
   - Works between **OS** and **application layers**

---

## What is an Error?

1. Anything that is **not acceptable** in a program  
2. Violates programming rules or grammar  
3. Prevents the program from compiling/executing

---

## Homework:

- Read about **Linker Error** and **Loader Error**
