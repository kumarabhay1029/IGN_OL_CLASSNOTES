## 🧑‍🏫 Teacher’s Tips

- As you add more notes, keep your filenames using:  
  `COURSE CODE covered topic.md`  
  (Example: `MCS_202 Trees and Graphs.md`).
- Add new links in your index so students always see what’s available.
- Group topics under their course for clarity.
- For PDF files, you can link them as shown above.

---

**NEXT STEP:**  
- Copy this structure and put it in your `index.html` file (in the root of your repo).
- Update links and sections as you add more notes.

If you add new files, just share their names and I’ll help you update your homepage!  
Let me know if you want me to generate the actual index.html code for you, ready to copy-paste.
